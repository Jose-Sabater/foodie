## Description

In this project I aim to create a small app that can give you information about how healthy you are eating.
It will offer you different options on what recipes to cook, what you have been eating in the past and how you can achieve
your nutrition goals.

It will then give you recommendation through statistical analytics.

This project has been mostly created as a showcase for Fastapi/Postresql.
