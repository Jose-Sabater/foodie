## Description

In this project I am to create a small app that can keep track of how many calories you are eating just by including  
information about your meal.  
It will then give you recommendation through statistical analytics on how to reach your goals.  

Some visualizations will also be provided

This project has been mostly created as a showcase for Fastapi/Postresql
